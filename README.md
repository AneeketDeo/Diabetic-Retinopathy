# Diabetic-Retinopathy
AI-guided diabetic retinopathy diagnosis and grading with risk assessment towards macular edema using fundus images

## Objectives
1. Implementation of pre-processing methods for image enhancement in fundus images containing retinopathic and non-retinopathic features.
2. Assesment of optimal pre-processing method in classification and distinction between retipathic and non-retinopathic images
3. Implementation of deep learning methods for assesment of retinopathy grade and risk of macular edema.
4. Deployment of the deep learning methods in Cloud and validation of these methods.
