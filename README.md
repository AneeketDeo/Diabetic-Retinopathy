# Diabetic-Retinopathy
AI-guided diabetic retinopathy diagnosis and grading with risk assessment towards macular edema using fundus images

## Objectives
Implementation of pre-processing methods for image enhancement in fundus images containing retinopathic and non-retinopathic features.
Assesment of optimal pre-processing method in classification and distinction between retipathic and non-retinopathic images
Implementation of deep learning methods for assesment of retinopathy grade and risk of macular edema.
Deployment of the deep learning methods in Cloud and validation of these methods.
